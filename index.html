                    The Thread Guide is a friendly and helpful service based in Winchester to
                    help you get the best from your sewing machine and overlocker.

                    The Thread Guide started when I had a problem with my own sewing machine and
                    I struggled to find a good service in Winchester or surrounding parts of
                    Hampshire that could help me repair it. Eventually, with a bit of help
                    (and some mis-direction!) from the internet, I figured out how to get my machine working.
                    After this I went on training courses to develop a better understanding
                    of sewing machines and overlockers and I learnt how to fix them properly.
                    Since then I've worked on many other machines and returned them to good working
                    order – and also helped their owners learn more about their machines and how
                    to use them better. So, how can I help you?

                If your machine isn't working properly, I offer maintenance, servicing and
                repairs for sewing machines and overlockers. <br>Prices start from £50. For a more
                detailed estimate, let's discuss what problem you're having and I can suggest
                an appropriate solution.  <br>And if I can't fix it, I won't charge you!

                If you aren't sure whether the problem is with your machine or with the way
                you are using it, I can check your machine (fixing anything necessary) and
                then give you a 1 to 1 session to get you sewing confidently.
